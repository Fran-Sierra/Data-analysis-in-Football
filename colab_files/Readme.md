### Plot_attacks_&_pass_nodes.
In this notebook you'll find the main functions that queries the data set in Big Query as well as those that later on are used by the functions Plot_attacks (circuit passes 15 seconds before a goal or a direct shot) and pass_nodes (formation between substitutions). 
Please take into account to change the variable `project_id` to your actual project id in big query (you must import the csv's to big query), otherwise, download the data to your drive or local storage (you will have to slightly modify the code).
